# Predicting Stock Price Direction Using Machine Learning

**Overview**

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict stock price direction (upward or downward movement) based on historical data and technical indicators. The goal is to build models that can make accurate predictions for stock price trends, helping traders and investors make data-driven decisions.

**Key Features**
* Data Preprocessing:
*   Historical stock price data collection (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
*   Feature engineering using technical indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, etc.
*   Data normalization and splitting into training and testing datasets.
* Machine Learning Models:
*   Implementation of various classification algorithms including:
*   Logistic Regression
*   Random Forest
*   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Prediction & Evaluation:

Predict the direction of stock price movement (up or down).
Evaluate models using cross-validation and backtesting techniques to assess performance on unseen data.

**Project Workflow**
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Download historical stock data and prepare input features.
Feature Engineering: Generate features using common technical indicators used in trading.
Model Training: Train machine learning models to predict the stock price direction.
Evaluation: Assess the model performance with various metrics and choose the best model based on accuracy and financial performance.
Prediction: Apply the trained model to make future stock price movement predictions.

**Dependencies**
* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
* yFinance / Alpha Vantage (for stock data collection)

**Data Sources**
* Stock Price Data: Retrieved from Yahoo Finance or other financial APIs such as Alpha Vantage.
* Technical Indicators: Calculated based on historical stock price data.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict stock price directions. By analyzing historical data and employing classification models, it attempts to provide insights into future price movements. While stock price prediction remains inherently challenging due to market volatility, the project illustrates the potential of data-driven strategies in financial forecasting.
